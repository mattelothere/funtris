| Requirements |
*--------------*
    The project has been tested on a Windows os, meaning that running it on other os may cause bugs or crashes
    -python version 3.10 must be installed
    -the 'os' python library must be installed
    -the file main.py must be run inside a command prompt, using "py main.py"
        > make sure that the working directory is at the root of the project
        (to ensure, type the command "dir" in the command prompt to list all visible files from the working directory,
        you should see a similar architecture :

        C:\Users\Name\>dir
        Volume in drive X is OS
        Volume Serial Number is XXXX-XXXX

         Directory of C:\Users\Name\Python Project

    Running the project in any other way was not intended, yet may still work

| How to play  |
*--------------*
    Once you ran the main.py file, you will be greeted with a title screen.
    We recommend continuing the execution on full screen, by pressing F11.
    Press enter to continue, and from there, you just have to follow the
    instructions displayed at the screen.

    Most of the time, the game asks you to input using small menus, looking like:

        ╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
        ║ What do you want to do : (enter the number associated) ║
        ╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
        1: show the rules
        2: start playing
        >

    You'll just have to type your choice and press enter to continue.
    For instance, if you want to read the rules, just type "1" then press enter.
    If you want to have the .txt version of them, you can open the file at the following address:
        /files/assets/rules.txt

    Everything else is explained via messages displayed in the chat
